Pour les p&eacute;riodes cl&ocirc;turant au 30 juin 2015 et au 30 juin 2016 nous avons utilis&eacute; les comptes combin&eacute;s (EUSRL + Asso) pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s &agrave; la DNCG en juin 2015.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1435854411809C-pnl.png' style='height:318px; width:550px' /></p><p>Sur les dix derni&egrave;res saisons le club a jou&eacute; 5 saisons en Ligue 1 (de 2004/05 &agrave; 2005/06 puis de 2011/12 &agrave; 2013/14) et 5 saisons en Ligue 2 (de 2006/07 &agrave; 2010/11). De la Ligue 1 &agrave; la Ligue 2 il existe une diff&eacute;rence importante quant &agrave; la distribution des droits TV qui repr&eacute;sente la principale source de revenu du club. Pour faire face &agrave; la baisse des droits TV de Ligue 1 &agrave; Ligue 2 le club calibre ses d&eacute;penses et notamment la masse salariale qui est sa principale source de d&eacute;penses.</p><p>En 2011/12 le club a g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; un exc&eacute;dent brut d&rsquo;exploitation positif de &euro; 4 MM gr&acirc;ce &agrave; sa promotion de Ligue 2 en Ligue 1 et l&rsquo;augmentation de ses revenus plus importante que ses d&eacute;penses (approche prudente sur la masse salariale). En 2012/13 le club a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de renforcer l&rsquo;&eacute;quipe augmentant ainsi la masse salariale at faisant baisser sa rentabilit&eacute; avec un EBE n&eacute;gatif de &euro; 1.4 MM. En 2013/14 la masse salariale a &eacute;t&eacute; un peu moins importante qu&rsquo;en 2012/13 notamment d&ucirc; &agrave; la rel&eacute;gation et le non-paiement de bonus de maintien limitant le d&eacute;ficit d&rsquo;exploitation malgr&eacute; une d&eacute;pense additionnelle li&eacute;e au licenciement de l&rsquo;entraineur principal (novembre 2013). La perte de revenu sur les droits TV engendr&eacute;e par la 20&egrave;me place a &eacute;t&eacute; combl&eacute;e par une subvention publique exceptionnelle. En 2014/15 le club a bien n&eacute;goci&eacute; le passage de Ligue 1 &agrave; Ligue 2 sur le plan comptable avec une r&eacute;duction importante de la masse salariale permettant apr&egrave;s mutations un b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net de pr&egrave;s d&rsquo;un million d&rsquo;euros comme annonc&eacute; &agrave; la DNCG en novembre 2014. Pour 2015/16 le club budg&egrave;te un b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net de &euro; 0.7 MM notamment du fait d&rsquo;un all&eacute;gement de la masse salariale suite aux fins de contrats de joueurs au salaire &laquo;&nbsp;ligue 1&nbsp;&raquo; tels que Pedretti ou Zubar. &nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>Le club d&eacute;pend principalement des droits TV et du soutien des autorit&eacute;s publiques de sa r&eacute;gion via le sponsoring et les subventions</li></ul><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1435854435894D-revenues.png' style='height:369px; width:550px' /></p><p>En 2013/14 le montant de droits TV minimal re&ccedil;u par un club de Ligue a &eacute;t&eacute; de &euro; 13 MM &agrave; comparer avec &euro; 6 MM qui a &eacute;t&eacute; le montant maximal re&ccedil;u par un club de Ligue 2.

La distribution des droits TV en Ligue 2 est diff&eacute;rente par rapport &agrave; la Ligue 1 avec 85% du montant partag&eacute; de mani&egrave;re &eacute;quitable entre les clubs et seulement 10% en fonction du classement (5% historique, 5% saison en cours) et 10% sur la notori&eacute;t&eacute; et la qualit&eacute; du centre de formation.

new Comment(4L, "<p><strong><u>P&amp;L </u></strong></p><p>In this section we analyze the profitability of the club as well as the structure of the Income Statement and associated risks. Our analysis is based on audited accounts by KMPG regarding AJ Auxerre SAOS and on management accounts presented to the DNCG as of 15/11/2014 for 2014/15 (combined SAOS + association). &nbsp;</p><p>2011/12 in Ligue 1 has marked a very difficult year for the club with a net loss of &euro; 16 mm. It is the direct consequence of poorer sports results while the club incurred higher costs and notably payroll to put a competitive team together for the participation to the UEFA Champions League in 2010/11. Thus in 2011/12 they could not adjust costs and suffered from the sharp drop in revenue (mostly broadcasting) which is the result of the 20th rank in Ligue 1. To face the situation the association AJ Auxerre the main shareholder of the club (100%) looked for investors and AJA XXL (Emmanuel Limido through his holding Paris Luxembourg Participations) invested &euro; 5 mm in the SAOS against a majority share of 60%. It has been done through a capital increase.</p><p>Then the club has been relegated in Ligue 2 after the 2011/12 season and thus incurring a new sharp drop in revenue from &euro;&nbsp; 25 mm in 2011/12 (Ligue 1) to &euro; 10.8 mm in 2012/13, &euro; 9.6 mm in 2013/14 and &euro; 8 mm in 2014/15. In 2012/13 and 2013/14 the club received &euro; 2 mm and &euro; 1 mm of parachute payment and thus now operate with a turnover circa &euro; 8 mm from 2014/15. In turn the club faces a situation in which its economic potential is limited and in the low end of &nbsp;Ligue 2 and thus needs to adjust costs to match this reality and minimize the dependence to highly volatile sales of players.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441377887063b-pnl.png' style='height:465px; width:550px' /></p><p>The club generates most of its revenue apart of the trading activity of players (non-recurring) from three streams of income:</p><ul>	<li>Matchday which is driven by sales of tickets in home games and season tickets;</li>	<li>Commercial that is mostly advertising at the stadium during games, sponsorship and merchandising;</li>	<li>Broadcasting that is money derived from TV rights and amounts paid to broadcast the games. It is centrally negotiated and distributed by the Ligue de Football Professionelle &ldquo;LFP&rdquo;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;The impact of playing in Ligue 1 vs Ligue 2 is very important in term of revenue generation mostly linked to much higher broadcasting income distributed to Ligue 1 clubs vs Ligue 2 clubs:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441377911543c-breakdown.png' style='height:348px; width:550px' /></p><p>A club like AJ Auxerre has an economic potential limited by its demography being only the 176th city in France with less than 40,000 inhabitants in a region &ldquo;Bourgogne&rdquo; where it is the 4th largest city behind Dijon, the capital of the region with a club that also plays in Ligue 2. It has made it very difficult for the club to develop commercial and matchday revenue and thus the club relies strongly from centrally distributed funds from TV rights.</p><p>The below gives a good picture of a club ability to generate revenue (excluding broadcasting) structurally and is a good indicator of the club economic capacity. It is clear that a club from Ligue 2 would increase naturally revenue when accessing to Ligue 1. Looking at AJ Auxerre the club when playing in Ligue 1 was able to generate around &euro; 8 mm in revenue excluding broadcasting and trading of players. In Ligue 2 this figure falls to &euro; 4 mm. Thus we consider that the club structurally competes against average Ligue 2 clubs:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441377932827d-benchmarkligue12.png' style='width:550px' /></p><p><em>Source: DNCG comptes individuels des clubs saison 2013/14</em></p><ul>	<li>Matchday revenue is limited to &euro; 0.5 mm in Ligue 2</li></ul><p>In Ligue 1 and except the year they played the UEFA Champions League in 2010/11 the club generated around &euro; 1.8 mm of matchday revenue for an average attendance in home games around 12,000. In term of attendance it is in the lower end of the Ligue 1 despite stadium capacity of 21,379 and in Ligue 2 average attendance is near 6,000 every year.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441377956880e-matchday.png' style='height:162px; width:550px' /></p><p>It is around the 10th attendance of the Ligue 2 depending on clubs participating and thus the club is on the lower end of Ligue 2 clubs regarding matchday income:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441377972294f-matchdaybis.png' style='height:291px; width:550px' /></p><p><em>Source: DNCG comptes individuels des clubs saison 2013/14</em></p><ul>	<li>Commercial income &nbsp;</li></ul><p>It regards mostly Sponsors paying for a corporate box at the stadium (~ &euro; 0.4 mm) in 2013/14 and 2014/15, main jersey sponsor (~ &euro; 0.6 mm), advertising at the stadium (~ 0.2 mm) and others (~ 0.4 mm). To develop such area of revenue is key for the club development but is however limited by the relatively low economic dynamism of Auxerre are in France vs peers and poor infrastructure regarding the stadium that is old and does not match the standards of modern Football that would enable the club to be more attractive for sponsors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441378022188g-commercialbenchmark.png' style='height:291px; width:550px' /></p><p><em>Source: DNCG comptes individuels des clubs saison 2013/14</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>Broadcasting is the largest stream of income for the club and represents more than 60% of the total revenue</li></ul><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441378053258h-broadcast.png' style='height:160px; width:550px' /></p><p>When looking at Ligue 2 TV rights distribution the equal share (including club license granted to 19 out of the 20 Ligue 2 clubs in 2014/15) represents more than 80% of the total. Thus between club which received the most in 2014/15 (&euro; 5.2 mm) received only 1.5x more than the club which received the less (&euro; 3.4 mm). 70% of clubs received between 4 and 5 mm. Thus a club like AJ Auxerre can expect to receive around &euro; 4.5 mm of broadcasting from its participation to Ligue 2 and slightly more in case of good results in national cups in 2015/16.</p><p>Note that including in other there is a parachute payment of &euro; 2 mm received during the 2012/13 season and &euro; 1 mm in 2013/14. It follows the relegation of the club from Ligue 1 to Ligue 2 after the 2011/12 season.</p><p>Looking forward and from the 2016/17 season with the increase in TV rights paid by broadcaster regarding the 2016-2020 cycle the club can expect around &euro; 6 mm in broadcasting in Ligue 2. This is considering the distribution system remains the same between clubs and between Ligue 1 / Ligue 2. If the club happens to be promoted in Ligue 1 it will be able to earn between &euro; 22 and 25 mm from broadcasting.</p><p>Thus now in Ligue 2 the club structurally is able so far to generate &euro; 8 mm of revenue in 2014/15 and 2015/16. It should increase to &euro; 9 -10 mm from 2016/17 we the new TV rights cycle. Thus the club should size expenses with this level of revenue. Efforts have been made but not sufficient to absorb the shortfall in revenue.</p><p><strong>Indeed the club in 2012/13 made an Ebitda loss before trading of players of &euro; 10 mm, &euro; 7 mm in 2013/14 and an estimated loss of &euro; 4 mm in 2014/15. </strong>The trend is positive and the club makes significant efforts to reduce costs notably the payroll:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441378083999i-expenses.png' style='height:391px; width:550px' /></p><p>However regarding their economic capacity in term of revenue generation the club should be in term of operating cost in a range of &euro; 8-9 million in line with the peers they compete with and to sustain Ebitda breakeven and the too high dependence on sales of players which are often difficult to forecast and non-recurring. &nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441378103542j-expensesbenchmark.png' style='height:282px; width:550px' /></p><p>The main variable of adjustment is the wages paid to players, staff and administration that should not be higher to 70% to maintain a sustainable economic model for the club and minimize the dependence on player&rsquo;s sales. The club made some efforts relying on young players from the academy but is still insufficient. In 2014/15 wage to turnover ratio is still high at 98% much higher than peers. The club spends &euro; 3-3.5 mm in the academy and thus needs to rely on academy players and be also able to sell one or two players every year to finance the cost of operations. &nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1441378125306k-payrolltoturnover.png' style='height:249px; width:550px' /></p><p>After depreciation mostly linked to amortization of infrastructure linked to the training center the club has made a cumulative loss of &euro; 39 mm from 2011/12 to 2013/14. Such loss is decreasing as costs have been reduced and investments in players limited with the club relying on its academy to fuel the first team. The estimated operating loss for 2014/15 is &euro; 5 mm.</p><p>So structurally the club needs to sell players in order to absorb the operating loss. They partially managed to do so in 2012/13 taking advantage of the player&rsquo;s portfolio &ldquo;Ligue 1&rdquo; to sell after the relegation. Despite most players left for free they made a capital gain of &euro; 11 mm from the sale of player&rsquo;s vs &euro; 13 mm operating loss. In 2013/14 and mostly thanks to the sale of Ntep a very high valued players they made a capital gain of &euro; 9 mm sufficient to cover the operating loss. So far in 2014/15 sales of players should not be sufficient to cover an operating loss circa &euro; 5 mm. It raises an important issue for the club as it is difficult while being in Ligue 2 to rely on sales of players for a capital gain higher than &euro; 2 mm equivalent to two good academy players from the estimations made by the club.</p><p>Thus the focus should be on reducing further the structural operating loss at a maximum of &euro; 2 mm an amount that could be reasonably covered by sales of players. If we take fixed costs circa &euro; 5 mm considering that the club invested and relies on its academy that incurs a cost circa &euro; 3.5 mm to operate. In such circumstances the club should size a payroll circa &euro; 5 mm that would be in the low tier of Ligue 2. Then it could increase payroll in line with new revenue generation. They notably have a development plan to sell their academy expertise internationally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is worth to note that a significant and non-recurring item has impacted the club operations in 2012/13. Indeed since Paris Luxembourg participations invested in the club in 2013. Thus association AJ Auxerre has less than 95% in SAOS AJ Auxerre and that has caused the end of tax group that formed the association with the SAOS. This situation had led to the recognition at 30/06/2013 of a receivable of &euro; 5.5 mm from the association AJ Auxerre (loss carry forward). It incurred an exceptional profit for the same amount. As of June 30th 2014 the receivable was still on the books of the SAOS.&nbsp;</p>", "club", 4L, null),

The club&rsquo;s revenue mix is dependent on TV and trading revenues with limited matchday and commercial revenues stemming from the Stadium&rsquo;s capacity and city size. The club is able to keep its young talents to sell them at an optimized price thanks to high wages which impacts EBITDA. As a result, the club balances its accounts (without the purpose of generating net profits) thanks to trading activity or current accounts.</strong></p><p><strong>Since December, 2011 and the takeover by Dmitri Rybolovlev the club started a new cycle with large investments into new players</strong> to integrate again the top 3 in Ligue 1 and to play in the UEFA Champions League on a regular basis. The club also aimed at developing commercial and matchday revenue focusing on the luxury image of Monaco bringing high net worth people in the stadium and luxury brands in the sponsorship portfolio.</p><p>The club invested around &euro; 15 mm in the winter mercato 2012 and finished 8th in Ligue 2 in 2011 &ndash; 12. The club named Claudio Ranieri, a world-class coach to run the team for the 2012 &ndash; 13 season with the objective to win the Ligue 2 and access to Ligue 1 again. They invested &euro; 25 mm in players to build a competitive team and the club in 2012 &ndash; 13 reached its target and accessed the Ligue 1 for the 2013 &ndash; 14 season. In summer 2013 the club put the project one step forward signing top class players such as Falcao, James Rodrigues, Joao Moutinho, Ricardo Carvalho, Toulalan, Abidal, for around &euro; 170 mm.</p><p><strong>However, the club in summer 2014 changed the strategy of its project facing potential sanctions from UEFA</strong> regarding the compliance to the UEFA breakeven requirement under financial fair play.

FY16, FY17 and FY18 are figures from management forecasts. &nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982709112b-KPI.png' style='height:82px; width:490px' /></p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982722164c-pnl.png' style='height:352px; width:550px' /></p><p>As stated in the annual report the board of directors has developed a management plan focused on financial management and stabilization of the balance sheet in the coming years. This plan focuses first on strict cost reduction, control and monitoring. It looks to increase profitability to generate free cash flow in order to face liabilities. In the industry context with most Liga clubs under strict cost control it has been possible without harming the competitiveness of the team and risking a relegation in second division. As a point of reference RCD in 2014/15 had the 9th largest budget of the Liga. There is a group of 7 teams with a budget under &euro; 30 million that compete together to avoid relegation. RCD competes with a group of clubs to be between 7th and 14th and eventually access to a spot granted European competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>From 2015/16 season the club will enjoy a strong increase in broadcasting revenue for the reasons explained before and linked to the historical agreement toward a collective bargaining scheme for broadcasting rights through LFP:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982751182d-revenue.png' style='height:364px; width:550px' /></p><p>The revenue generated by the club has been impacted these past years by the economic crisis in Spain with lower numbers of socios and season tickets holders. As a result matchday went from &euro; 12.6 million in FY12 down to &euro; 8.6 million in FY15. The club since 2014/15 contracted a head coach with the objective to play attractive Football and re attract fans to the stadium. On the other side the club made significant effort to commercialize the stadium and the brand to increase commercial revenue.</p><p>To face the decrease in revenue the club had to focus on reducing costs in order to maintain sufficient profitability:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982769643e-costs.png' style='height:290px; width:550px' /></p><p>Management managed to decrease the cost of payroll while maintaining the competitiveness of the team which looks positive. The cash cost base around &euro; 35 million is sustainable in our view vs recurring revenues &euro; 40 million and the positive increase in revenue for 2015/16 and further due to increasing broadcasting rights. Wage to turnover ratio is far below the maximum threshold of 70% set up by UEFA and in line with best credits of the industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In turn the club has been able to generate strong profitability in the past years with Ebitda margins higher than 20% and in line with the top standards in the industry. The past three years the club has been able to generate a &euro; 34 million positive Ebitda.</p><p>The amortization charge regards mostly depreciation of player&rsquo;s contracts rights for ~ 80% and depreciation of tangible assets for ~ 20% (stadium, training center&hellip;). As the club limits investments in new players the charge of amortization is decreasing over years. However the past 3 years the charge of amortization has been slightly higher than the Ebitda generated especially in 2014/15. In turn the club is near breakeven in term of operating result.</p><p>It then relies on sales of players to pay financial interests on its debt and absorb a potential operating loss as it has been the case in 2014/15.</p><p><u>Looking forward statement: </u></p><p>The increase in broadcasting rights offers very positive prospects to the club in term of profitability. Indeed the additional revenue will be firstly dedicated to increase profitability and the club will maintain costs at conservative level in view of targeted profitability. Below is the management forecast for the next four years. We have challenged the management assumptions for their forecast and it seems adequate in our view.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982792909f-forecast.png' style='height:372px; width:550px' /></p><p>The 2015/16 forecast is 95% secured with commercial contracts already signed, season ticket sold and broadcasting rights certified by LFP. Broadcasting rights forecasted are a minimum scenario in function of the social criteria still being defined by LFP. Note that, according to management, in term of commercial revenue the club only forecasted for 50% of the Power 8 contract regarding 2015/16 that corresponds to the part already cashed by the club. The club is in litigation regarding the remaining part and will likely terminate the contract after December. The club is already working on a new main sponsor for the seasons after.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Focus on broadcasting under the new collective distribution model:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982818239g-broadcasting.png' style='height:311px; width:532px' /></p><p>* deductions regard operating expenses of LFP, payments to second division clubs and other solidarity contributions to grassroots as fixed by the royal decree.</p><p>Note that all amounts have been communicated by LFP and can be viewed as a conservative scenario for clubs to process financial planning. Some rights are still in sales process including domestic TV rights for the 2016/17 season and after. Most international contracts have been signed already. The ranking part share has been communicated by the LFP and is definitive based for 2015/16 season as based on past 5 years results from 2010-11 to 2014-15. The 2% and then 3% in social share assumes the most conservative scenario as the minimum to be received by a club per the Royal decree. Indeed the LFP estimates this share to be 3.25% for RCD thus if it is the case the amount to be received by the club should be higher by &euro; 3 million. &nbsp;</p><p>Here is the detail of the repartition according to ranking (historical 5 years with a 35% / 25% / 15% / 15% / 15%) ponderation for each year from the most recent to the last recent:&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1444982835415h-rankingshare.png' style='height:401px; width:162px' /></p><p>Under the agreement it is agreed a parachute payment for the three relegated clubs. This parachute would amount to &euro; 12 million per club (LFP source) regarding clubs relegated during the 2015/16 season and after. In second division it is estimated that RCD if relegated would receive between &euro; 6 and 8 million of TV rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "club", 62L, null),

In addition, since July, 2015 FC Porto and its subsidiary FC Porto Futebol SAD decided to keep 25% of socios contributions within FC Porto and then only transfer 75% in the SAD vs 100% previously.</p><p>Despite the constant increase in revenues, even though heavily depending on UCL participation, the club has not been able to structure costs to reduce the volatility of bottom line results which depend heavily on profits from the trading activity of players and are more and more captured by the increased interest charge paid to financial institutions.</p><p>Indeed, the club has a cash cost structure, before amortization of players&rsquo; rights and infrastructure, of around 40 M&euro; of operating costs excluding payroll which is already around 50% of its revenue. Adding up payroll, more volatile by nature, cash costs are above revenues generated every year (around 125% of revenue):&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1477584817053hcostsdetails.png' style='height:438px; width:550px' /></p><p>The increase in costs in 2015-16 vs 2014-15 is mainly due to:</p><ul>	<li>3.5 M&euro; image rights paid to players;</li>	<li>4.4 M&euro; of indemnities paid to the dismissed coach Julen Lopetegui and his staff (included in payroll &ndash; other)</li></ul><p>The increase in wages paid to players in 2014-15 and 2015-16 did not traduce with higher sports performances, on the contrary. Thus, it accentuated the operating loss generated by the club. Indeed, adjusted Ebitda takes into consideration adjusted revenue:</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1477584851076iEbitda.png' style='height:62px; width:550px' /></p><p>When we add up the amortization charge it leaves the club with an operating loss above 45 M&euro; every year to be covered by net capital gains on sales of players. The increase in amortization other is linked to the amortization of the stadium within the perimeter of consolidation since 2014-15.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1477584873423joploss.png' style='height:101px; width:550px' /></p><p>In addition, the club because of the increase of its debt position pays more and more interests on debt.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1477584900828knetfinancialresult.png' style='height:157px; width:550px' /></p><p>It leaves thus a very large structural loss that the club needs to cover by the sale of players every year, an activity which is very volatile by nature and put the club in a very difficult situation. Furthermore, such structural loss increases more and more while the club faces very intensive international competition for the scouting and development of players. It has been managed through very extensive sports expertise in scouting, development of players, management of the team and networks to sell players. However, such business model is not sustainable in our view on the long run looking at the European football industry environment with more extensive regulations from UEFA (financial fair play) and the fast development of competitors in other leagues. On the UEFA financial fair play review for 2017-18 season, the club will be in deviation from the maximum authorized loss reported for the cumulated seasons from 2013-14 until 2015-16 (monitoring period) and may face sanctions from UEFA.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1477584937273lnetresult.png' style='height:161px; width:550px' /></p><p>Acquisitions and sales of players come with high transactional costs (TPO %, agents&rsquo; commissions, signing fees etc) and it is more and more difficult to sustain a positive balance.

It represents more than 70% of its total income every year.</p><p>With the collective bargaining of the rights starting in 2015-16 (transition year) and fully into place since 2016-17 and secured until 2018-19, Getafe benefits from a strong increase in revenue. It will also place the club at an advantage versus peers in Primera division (group of 6-7 clubs competing to remain in Liga BBVA) thanks to past performance with the historical 5 years ranking being an important component of the TV Rights distribution. In 2015-16 the club ranks 10th in this criteria. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However the club has a limited economic potential as regard to matchday revenue with an old stadium owned by the council and with a limited capacity of 17,000 seats. Attendance at the stadium is the main driver of revenue as regard to this segment and is the lowest in Primera division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the commercial size visibility of Getafe is rather limited and behind the two Madrid giants Real and Atletico. The club relies on a network of local sponsors of which the main sponsor is Techno casa for 500 K&euro; a year. It renews recently the agreement for an increased value of 850 K&euro; per season por an additional three years.</p><p>Other income regards mainly a 3.5 M&euro; annual subsidy to be received from Getafe council based on an agreement signed in January, 2010 and that cover from the 2009-10 season until the 2013-14 season. In 2013-14 the club did not recognize such income as a principle of precaution and because of litigation with the council.</p><p>As regard to costs and coming into force since the 2013-14 season the club must comply with the strict requirements and monitoring of LFP economic control. It includes a breakeven requirement (relevant income &ndash; relevant expense) with a maximum cumulated deviation (deficit) over a period of 3 years of 5 M&euro; and a maximum payroll (professional team only) of 70% out of the total income. As confirmed by management the club as for the 2015-16 season complies with all LFP economic control requirements.</p><p>Indeed it has been a first priority of the club to reduce costs in order to breakeven, comply with LFP economic control and be able to generate operating cash flow to meet liabilities. From 2013-14 to 2014-15 the wage costs linked to players, staff and administration has been divided by 2 from 40 M&euro; to 21 M&euro; that is in 2014-15 a wage to turnover ratio of 77%. Amortization of players rights decreased as the club sold the most valued players to face liquidity issues. In addition the club relied on players on loan from other teams to have access to good quality players at a lower cost (part of the wage has been taken by the loaning club often cash rich).&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015-16 the club will rely on a strict cost control policy that coupled with the increase of revenue will allow them to enhance strongly the profitability with an Ebitda margin superior to 20%.</p><p>It will then rely less on sales of players and be able to re-invest in the team in wages and at a lesser extent transfer fees.</p><p>The financial interests regard mostly in interests paid on the current credit facility and the forecasted new one. The shareholders loans have an annual interest of 5.5% but only in case the club generates a net profit. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The net profit generated will strengthened the equity position and the cash generated meet ST liabilities and enhance the liquidity of the club and allow the club to reduce the exposure to financial debt and thus payment to financial interests. &nbsp;</p><p>The cash flow below illustrates the fact that the club used to rely on sales of players to cover negative operating cash flow net of working capital change and interests paid on debt. In 2013-14 the club had to deal with a large operating loss and thus negotiated extended terms of payments with the players on wages as well as they had to delay payments regarding tax and social liabilities. In 2014-15 the club took a loan from Bravo Capital structured on the TV rights to refinance social and tax liabilities.</p><p>At today the club is up to date with all tax and social liabilities payments as well as they changed the policy as regard to payments to players wages with at the end of June an expected 35-30% of total payroll in debt as regard to bonuses and wages of June.</p><p>The cash flow forecast includes a new facility of 24 M&euro; for 2015-16 to refinanced the current facility and that will be rolled over every year for a decreased amount sized with the cash needs of the club.</p><p>The cash flow forecast reflects also the club re investment in players to strengthen the squad. The activity of players trading is a variable of adjustment for the club.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1456153650495Ecashflow.png' style='height:321px; width:550px' /></p>", "club", 82L, null),

The club is currently discussing with the council, owner of San Paolo stadium, about a renovation of the stadium. Such re development will include a decrease in overall capacity and uplift in term of hospitalities and VIP seats.</p><p>After several years of profit, SSC Napoli registered net losses in FY15 (&euro; -13 MM), mostly because of the non-participation to Champions&rsquo; League.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=14780751937913.png' style='height:370px; width:600px' /></p><p><strong>SSC Napoli is relatively dependent on broadcasting rights </strong>that represent every year 50-60%, some years up to 65%, of its revenue excluding trading. The club generates ~ &euro; 110 &ndash; 130 MM of revenue when they do not participate to Champions League and up to &euro; 160 &ndash; 170 MM when they do.</p><p>Two main drivers can explain SSC Napoli decrease in revenues during FY15 vs FY14:</p><ol>	<li><u>The non-participation to Champions&rsquo; League</u> has directly affected broadcasting revenues (FY14-FY15: &euro; -28 MM) despite good performances in UEFA Europa League (semi-finals).

Nevertheless, cost management can be adjusted for FY16.</strong> Indeed, it has to be compared with the previous year that has seen exceptional sales of players on which the club can capitalize. Operating losses are mainly due to:</p><ul>	<li><u>Personal expenses</u>: Since SSC Napoli expected to play UEFA CL, it maintained its payroll at a high level but with lower revenues. Thus, the payroll to revenue is higher in FY15 compared to last seasons (68% vs 54%, 57%, and 39% in 2014, 2013, and 2012).</li>	<li><u>Depreciation</u> which has remained high for the same reason.</li>	<li><u>Decreasing revenues</u></li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, P&amp;L structure can be balanced and is sustainable even when considering no participation to the UEFA CL</strong>, providing wages expenses are adjusted to sporting results to maintain a level of ~ 55% of revenue without trading.

This represents an increase of around &euro; 5 mm per season for Sampdoria.</p><p>Starting from the 2010-11 season, the sale of broadcasting rights has been managed centrally and collectively by the national league, LNP. The main national broadcaster is <em>Sky Italia</em>. There are five elements that contribute to the overall deal.

These big clubs benefit from the <strong>notoriety criteria as well as strong past sports results</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;The club received &euro; 41 mm for 2014/15 season which represents a strong increase compared to 2013/14 (&euro; 32 mm, +27%).</p><ul>	<li><u>Increasing matchday revenues</u>, notably impacted by the rise in membership revenues (&euro; 3 mm in FY15 vs &euro; 2.5 mm in FY14) which shows the <strong>notoriety of the club</strong> from its fans.</li></ul><p>The club plays in the stadium &ldquo;<em>Luigi Ferraris&rdquo;</em> with a capacity of 36,703 seats. The stadium is owned by the municipality and has been built in 1909. The stadium is used by the two clubs of Genoa Sampdoria and Genoa CFC.

Note it will participate to Champions League play-off in 2017 &ndash; 18 and is consequently guaranteed at least a participation in Europa League.The three main drivers of sales are (i) broadcasting revenues (ii) commercial revenues (iii) trading revenues.</p><p>(i) <u>Broadcasting </u>revenues are following an increasing trend:</p><p>1. Domestic revenues have been increasing due to:</p><p>a. <strong>Good performance of Sevilla on the pitch</strong> (3 successive Europa Leagues from 2014 to 2016, 4th rank in La Liga in 2016 &ndash; 17) that allowed the club to renegotiate its domestic TV rights (2013 &ndash; 14: &euro; 33 mm, 2014 &ndash; 15: &euro; 39 mm, 2015 &ndash; 16: &euro; 48 mm)</p><p>b. <strong>The transition in 2015 &ndash; 16 from individual negotiation between clubs and broadcasters to a collective bargaining</strong> between the Liga de F&uacute;tbol Profesional and the broadcasters that gives more bargaining power to clubs other than Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.

Thus in 2016-17 we can expect at least &euro; 60 mm&nbsp;of domestic broadcasting.</p><p>2. UEFA revenues are also following an increasing trend:</p><p>a. <strong>Good performance of Sevilla on the pitch</strong> with a 5th participation in a row in 2017 &ndash; 18. The augmentation of revenues in 2015 &ndash; 16 is related to (i) participation to Champions League group stage with higher participation bonus and market pool (ii) new UEFA cycle (2015 &ndash; 18) with higher revenues (participation and performance bonus, market pool)</p><p>b. <strong>Future UEFA TV rights cycle (2018 &ndash; 21)</strong> with a domestic market pool of &euro; 230 mm vs &euro; 160 mm for the current cycle</p><p><strong>To mitigate the risk of non-participation to UEFA, the club applies a strategy of high payroll to recruit quality players.</strong> Furthermore, it had 334 employees (28 professional players) in 2015 &ndash; 16 vs 283 employees (27 professional players in 2016 &ndash; 17). Ergo, payroll cost increased in 2015 &ndash; 16 (&euro; 87 mm vs &euro; 75 mm in 2014 &ndash; 15):</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=15002932717665.png' style='height:270px; width:450px' /></p><p><strong>However, this ratio is experiencing a decreasing trend</strong> related to the increase in revenues from broadcasting and, to a lower extent, matchday and commercial.

new Comment(175L, "<p>Since 2012-13 season the club has been playing in the English Premier League benefiting from the strong increase in central funds. In addition, the club has proven to be well managed with regular ranking in the top 10 and an outstanding academy providing a substantial source of revenues through the sale of academy players to cash rich English clubs in addition to feeding the first team. In addition the club has invested 30 M&pound; &nbsp;in a new (since 2014) training ground to attract players &nbsp;and optimize training of players.</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr:443/image/download?name=1512657050035c-ranking.png' style='height:77px; width:550px' /></p><p><strong>P&amp;L: </strong></p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr:443/image/download?name=1512657075009dpnl.png' style='height:364px; width:550px' /></p><p><em>Operating revenues </em></p><p>The club has a turnover excluding trading of players in the mid table (10th considering 2015-16 financials) of the Premier League with a strong dependence to central incomes that represent more than 70% of their recurring revenues (excluding players trading).</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr:443/image/download?name=1512657095748erevenues.png' style='height:332px; width:550px' /></p><p>Looking at the 2015-16 figures <strong>matchday</strong> revenue is pretty flat and we do not see much increase (without an increased capacity, redevelopment) in the future in such segment in consideration of the club operating at full capacity (95% attendance rate). With around 18 M&pound; in matchday revenue the club has the highest revenue in this segment after the top 6 (Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool) and West Ham.</p><p>It is their competitive advantage vs peers in particular in view of a relatively high average attendance around 31,000 coupled with a quite modern infrastructure built in 1999.</p><p>However, the club lags peers as regard to <strong>commercial income</strong> and this an area of potential economic growth for the club especially in view of current good on pitch performances. In 2016 the club has signed a new partnership with Under Armour as the team kit supplier. Such deal runs from 2016-17 to 2022-23. No financials figures have been disclosed but we can expect that the value of the deal to be significantly higher than previous Adidas deal considering current market conditions. In addition, starting in 2016-17 will also be a new multi-million &pound; three years deals with Sportpesa. Virgin media also becomes from 2016-17 (three years deal) the main sponsor of the club. Thus, with these three main deals we can expect the commercial revenue of the club from 2016-17 to be significantly higher. &nbsp;</p><p>Broadcasting revenue follows deals negotiated centrally by the Premier league and that work by cycle. Indeed from 2013 to 2016 the club has benefited from the increase vs the former 2010-2013 cycle. In addition, the club will see a new strong rise (+ 46%) in broadcasting from 2016 to 2019 under the new cycle. Distribution ratio between 1st and 20th is 1,5x which makes the more equal distribution among the big 5 leagues. The main bulk is distributed equally (~ 70%) while ~ 15% depends on the season ranking and another 15% on the number of games broadcasted. Southampton has taken benefit of good sports results to drive more broadcasting revenue.</p><p>See below distribution of central funds for 2015-16 and 2016-17 (source Premier League):</p><p><strong>2015-16 </strong></p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr:443/image/download?name=1512657118591fbroadcasting1.png' style='height:440px; width:550px' /></p><p><strong>2016-17</strong></p><p><strong><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr:443/image/download?name=1512657173668gbroadcasting2.png' style='height:440px; width:550px' /></strong></p><p><em>Operating expenses and Ebitda </em></p><p>The main source of expenses for the club relies on wages paid to staff and players which stands at 85 M&pound; in 2015-16. As regard to 2015-16 figures it is a wage bill in line with peers apart of the top 6. Wages paid to players are strictly controlled by the Premier League (short term cost control E18 to E22) and thus Southampton FC cannot increase the wage bill by more than 7 M&pound; except if such increase is funded by the club own resources (average last 3 years transfer, commercial and matchday).</p><p>The wage to turnover ratio is under control thus and around 70%. It is in the top tier of Premier League clubs but in line with recommended ratio by UEFA and it allows the club to retain to top talents and attract players in line with their scouting strategy (academy and first team).&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr:443/image/download?name=1512657195846hcosts.png' style='height:308px; width:550px' /></p><p>The profitability of the club is good with a pre-trading of players positive Ebitda margin above 10%. It is not sufficient cash flow generation to fund investments in players and after amortization the club operating profit is negative around 20 M&pound; in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Note that provisions are not disclosed and might have an impact on the Ebitda are they are included in operating expenses.</p><p>Amortization of players rights results from investments made in the team and transfer fees paid to buy top players as reported by the increase in intangible assets (85 M&pound; at year end FY16 vs 41 M&pound; at year end FY14) and thus amortization in the P&amp;L.</p><p><em>Player trading</em></p><p>Nevertheless, it serves a clear strategy from the club which has driven benefits from the development of players from the academy or purchased from third party clubs. Indeed, net profit from trading of players (transfer fee less book value of players and other transaction fees) stands at 107 M&pound; cumulated over the past 3 years and is higher than the amortization of players expense. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016-17 the club forecasts in its management report sales of players for 58 M&pound; (Man&eacute;, Pell&eacute;, Wanyama, Fonte) and purchases for 65 M&pound; (Boufal, Gabbiadini, Hojbjerg, Redmond&hellip;). Most of players sold have been bought in 2014-15 and thus have a substantial book value. We can thus for 2016-17 estimate a net trading profit around 30 M&pound;. The amortization charge of players will continue to increase due to the level of investment in 2016-17.</p><p><em>Exceptional items and financial costs </em></p><p>In 2015-16 it refers mainly to a FX loss (Swiss Franc debt repayments) of 4 M&pound; and compensation fee of 4 M&pound; to be received.</p><p>In 2014-15 it refers to 8M&pound; one off cost due to the cancellation of contracts.</p><p>Most of the financial result concerns non-cash items such as imputed interest charge on transfer fee receivable (3 M&pound; non-cash income in 2015-16) and imputed interest charge on transfer fee payable (3M&pound; non-cash expense in 2015-16). It results from the application of the new accounting standard FRS 102 since 2015-16.</p><p>Cash items regard mostly interests paid on loans that account for around 3 M&pound; every year. The 2,5 M&pound; interest charge on loans in 2015-16 represents 20% of the Ebitda and 5% of the debt position.</p><p><em>Net profits </em></p><p>All in all, the club has been profitable with a 50M&pound; cumulated net profit over the past three years mostly driven by net profit on trading of players (107 M&pound; cumulated) to cover a pre-trading operating loss of 41 M&pound; cumulated and 8 M&pound; of net interests paid on debt.</p><p><em>Looking forward </em></p><p><strong>2016-17</strong></p><p>The 2016-17 financial statements have not been published at the date of this report.

Indeed, they generated a cumulated 56 M&pound; over the past 3 years.</p><p>After working capital and payment of taxes and interests cumulated operating cash flow for the past 3 years is 48 M&pound;. We expect this trend to continue in 2016-17 and 2017-18.</p><p>It has allowed the club to invest in infrastructures (26 M&pound; investment in the past 3 years) and in players (net investment of 39 M&pound;). The investment in infrastructures regards the new training ground Staplewood campus inaugurated in 2014 (total investment around 30 M&pound;).</p><p>It leaves a negative cumulated free cash flow of 17 M&pound; funding by the increase in debt (+ 28 M&pound;). It is to be noted that in 2015-16 the club generated a positive free cash flow (operating cash flow net of investments) mainly due to positive cash flow from trading of players and lower investments in infrastructures.</p><p>All in all, the club increased its cash position by 9 M&pound; cumulating the past three years and it is mainly due to the increase level of debt. In 2016-17 and after we expect the club to be able to generate sufficient free cash flow to decrease or at least maintain the debt at current level. It will mostly depend on the investments in players vs sales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "club", 175L, null),

Even though the average league attendance fell 2% from 34,720 to 34,007, match day revenue still rose in 2013/14, largely due to season ticket price rises plus money from the Capital One Cup run. It is the 8th highest matchday revenue within the Premier League (2012/13 season benchmark).</p><p>The club will move for the 2016/17 season in the Olympic Stadium and they signed an agreement to sell their Boleyn Ground stadium in preparation to this move. The Olympic stadium has a 54,000 seats capacity (vs 35,016 at Boleyn Ground) and the club agreed commercial terms with London Legacy Development Corporation&nbsp;over a 99 years tenancy with &pound; 15 MM upfront fee and an estimated &pound; 2.5 MM per year rent.</p><p>The club managed to generate &pound; 20 MM in commercial revenue in 2012/13 and 2013/14 which is the 8th highest amount of the Premier League (2012/13 benchmark). The main sponsor of the club Altari (~ &pound; 3 MM per year) went insolvent in January, 2015 and the club as early as February, 2015 signed a record deal of an estimated &pound; 20 MM for three and half year with Betway.</p><p>After 28 games in the 2014/15 season the club ranks 10th with a comfortable 17 points cushion onto the first relegation spot.</p><p>This &pound; 25 MM increase in revenue has allowed <strong>the club to post a solid &pound; 33 MM Ebitda profit</strong> (28.5% margin) vs &pound; 18 MM in 2012/13 thanks to conservative cost management with limited increase in the wage bill by &pound; 8 MM. In 2012/13 the club had the 14th highest wage bill only of the Premier league while posting the 8th highest revenue. It has been helped by the new financial fair play premier league regulation that limits the increase in wages.&nbsp;</p><p><img alt='' src='https://first.sportvalue.fr/image/download?name=1426090238095C-costbreakdown.png' style='height:362px; width:600px' /></p><p>However bottom line results have long been impacted by the debt burden with the club having paid &pound; 5 MM in financial interests in 2013/14 nothing less than one third of its Ebit for 2013/14. In 2012/13 they paid also &pound; 5 MM of financial interests a figure higher than its operating profit of &pound; 3 MM.</p><p>Regarding its trading activity the club has not a track record of selling well its players and did not generate substantial capital gains on the sales of players over the past 5 years. Note that the club in summer 2014 invested around &pound; 30 MM in new players mostly for the acquisitions of Valencia, Kouyat&eacute; and Sakho.</p><p>Looking forward and 2014/15 results we can expect the same structure of P&amp;L with &pound; 70 MM secured revenue from TV rights, matchday revenue fueled by good sports results so far and commercial revenues to increase following Betway deal. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>", "club", 205L, null),
